<h2>CSS Concepts</h2>

<p>
  CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web
  browsers according to W3C specifications. Previously, the development of
  various parts of CSS specification was done synchronously, which allowed the
  versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard about CSS1,
  CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything
  is now CSS without a version number.
